		<p>
			We are introducing Libs for small with dynamic books available to boost your child’s creativity. Our major objective is to awaken your children's inner drive and encourage them to think for themselves by broadening their imagination.
			<br /><br />
			LibForSmalls is the act of releasing small children's books "into the wild" for a stranger to locate or to another LibForSmalls member via "managed release," and monitoring where they travel through journal entries.
			<br /><br />
			We are a platform mediator to buy and sell children’s books at many affordable prices.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>What To do with the children’s Book?</strong>
			<br />
			We will assist you to swap your books with some more fun books for the kids. Let the flow of knowledge go on.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>Before the swap</strong>
			<br />
			Invite a diverse group of readers. Invite older readers who can trade chapter books and younger readers who can swap picture books. Families should be encouraged to bring "excellent" books. Consider several types of books. For added fun, have your kids create simple bookmarks with a two-sentence summary or rating of the book for the books they're bringing.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>During the swap</strong>
			<br />
			Have a few adults on present to assist the children in making their decisions. Adults can direct children to books that are appropriate for their reading ability or interest area. Encourage your children to recommend books as well. Enlist them to be the "expert" on the books they brought to the swap.
			<br /><br />
			<strong>After the Swap</strong>
			<br />
			Determine what to deal with the remaining books. Perhaps you can change it out with the assistance of our website. Unclaimed books can also be donated to a library, homeless shelter, or children's hospital.
