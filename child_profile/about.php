                  <h2><b>Welcome to Child Immunization Tracking System</b></h2>
                  <p>Computerized immunization registries track each child's vaccinations and feed that information into a national database. This personalized recording system allows for individualized follow-up, helping to ensure that children receive all necessary vaccinations even if the children move to another area of the country.</p>
                  <h2><b>Our smart approach</b></h2>
                
                  </ul>
                  <p>By tracking this information, immunization programs can reduce the number of defaulters (people who do not return for immunizations when they are due), find the unimmunized, and ensure that the right vaccines are distributed when and where they are needed. This minimizes vaccine wastage, loss, and stockouts. This system also allows for lot tracing down to the individual child receiving the vaccination, which is essential for vaccine safety and management of adverse events following immunization.</p>
